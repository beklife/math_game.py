# math_game.py

I wanted to write a program that helps me practice my addition, subtraction, and multiplication using only the integers 0 through 9. And I made it!
If you want to play that cool game, you'll need I’ll Command Prompt or you can also use other terminal applications like Git Bash, Windows Powershell, Mac Terminal — any of these will allow you to run Python scripts from the command line. Good luck!!!
